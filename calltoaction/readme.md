My name is Éloi Strée.

My goal in life is to have fun with code.
Lead by the curiosity of knowing what we can code with new technologies.  
In the past I teached Unity3D and have been coding small games through an activity of [Smartbe.be](https://smartbe.be/en) 

In 2023-2025, I want to be dedicated to code for the Lynx R1 (and so to the Quest 3 too).  
In 2023-2030, I am working to make Open Macro Input become a used software on Window and Android XR. 



## How you can help me explore the Lynx R1 ?

- Teaching is the best way to master a topic. I am always in to teach on specific topic.
- I always open to do prototype, experiment or small application of less that 5 weeks duration.
- I will be available of coding feature on the Lynx R1 or the Quest 3

## How you can help me develop Open Macro Input ?

- The software I am developing need to be tested in real life.
  - I am open to any suggestion.
- The software was oriented recently to be able to be test on console.
  - I am looking a QA company in video game that would see the potentiel of the tool in their team.
- As I am not a campany yet, the only way I can invest on the project is by working from it as service
   - I learn a ton of small skills to be able to pull out the projet and I available if need me to teach a topic.
